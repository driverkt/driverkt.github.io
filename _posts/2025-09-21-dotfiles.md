I've been working on my <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps; cursor: pointer;" title="A set of configuration files that one can use to customize one's shell and applications">dotfiles</span> a lot over the past indefinite while. I may do a series of posts about them, especially the most interesting facets of select files. 

Though they are by now quite bespoke, I'm certain there will be a few worthwhile tidbits to pass along which are broadly applicable. 

Mine inherit from the work of several famous ancestors (in no particular order):

- [pstadler/dotfiles/](https://github.com/pstadler/dotfiles/)
- [jessfraz/dotfiles/](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/)
