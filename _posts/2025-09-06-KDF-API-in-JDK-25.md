JDK 25 is [scheduled to GA very soon](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/25/). When it is released, the KDF API will officially join the rest of the JCE APIs, via [JEP 510](https://openjdk.org/jeps/510) (a minimal revision of [JEP 478](https://openjdk.org/jeps/478)).

KDF brings another of the critical building-blocks enabling post-quantum cryptography support in the Java programming language. 

Planning to keep pace with evolving cryptography standards?  Adopt JDK 25 and make use of this new API!
